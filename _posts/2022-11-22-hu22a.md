title: 'Distributionally Robust Survival Analysis: A Novel Fairness Loss Without Demographics'
software: https://github.com/discovershu/DRO_COX
abstract: 'We propose a general approach for training survival analysis models that
  minimizes a worst-case error across <em>all</em> subpopulations that are large enough
  (occurring with at least a user-specified minimum probability). This approach uses
  a training loss function that does not know any demographic information to treat
  as sensitive. Despite this, we demonstrate that our proposed approach often scores
  better on recently established fairness metrics (without a significant drop in prediction
  accuracy) compared to various baselines, including ones which directly use sensitive
  demographic information in their training loss. Our code is available at: https://github.com/discovershu/DRO_COX'

title: A for-loop is all you need. For solving the inverse problem in the case of
  personalized tumor growth modeling
software: https://github.com/IvanEz/for-loop-tumor
abstract: Solving the inverse problem is the key step in evaluating the capacity of
  a physical model to describe real phenomena. In medical image computing, it aligns
  with the classical theme of image-based model personalization. Traditionally, a
  solution to the problem is obtained by performing either sampling or variational
  inference based methods. Both approaches aim to identify a set of free physical
  model parameters that results in a simulation best matching an empirical observation.
  When applied to brain tumor modeling, one of the instances of image-based model
  personalization in medical image computing, the overarching drawback of the methods
  is the time complexity of finding such a set. In a clinical setting with limited
  time between imaging and diagnosis or even intervention, this time complexity may
  prove critical.  As the history of quantitative science is the history of compression
  (Schmidhuber and Fridman, 2018), we align in this paper with the historical tendency
  and propose a method compressing complex traditional strategies for solving an inverse
  problem into a simple database query task. We evaluated different ways of performing
  the database query task assessing the trade-off between accuracy and execution time.
  On the exemplary task of brain tumor growth modeling, we prove that the proposed
  method achieves one order speed-up compared to existing approaches for solving the
  inverse problem. The resulting compute time offers critical means for relying on
  more complex and, hence, realistic models, for integrating image preprocessing and
  inverse modeling even deeper, or for implementing the current model into a clinical
  workflow. The code is available at https://github.com/IvanEz/for-loop-tumor.

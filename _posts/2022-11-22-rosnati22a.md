title: Analysing the effectiveness of a generative model for semi-supervised medical
  image segmentation
abstract: Image segmentation is important in medical imaging, providing valuable,
  quantitative information for clinical decision-making in diagnosis, therapy, and
  intervention. The state-of-the-art in automated segmentation remains supervised
  learning, employing discriminative models such as U-Net. However, training these
  models requires access to large amounts of manually labelled data which is often
  difficult to obtain in real medical applications. In such settings, semi-supervised
  learning (SSL) attempts to leverage the abundance of unlabelled data to obtain more
  robust and reliable models. Recently, generative models have been proposed for semantic
  segmentation, as they make an attractive choice for SSL. Their ability to capture
  the joint distribution over input images and output label maps provides a natural
  way to incorporate information from unlabelled images. This paper analyses whether
  deep generative models such as the SemanticGAN are truly viable alternatives to
  tackle challenging medical image segmentation problems. To that end, we thoroughly
  evaluate the segmentation performance, robustness, and potential subgroup disparities
  of discriminative and generative segmentation methods when applied to large-scale,
  publicly available chest X-ray datasets.

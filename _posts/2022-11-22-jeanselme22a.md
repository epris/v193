title: 'Imputation Strategies Under Clinical Presence: Impact on Algorithmic Fairness'
software: https://github.com/Jeanselme/ClinicalPresenceFairness
abstract: Biases have marked medical history, leading to unequal care affecting marginalised
  groups. The patterns of missingness in observational data often reflect these group
  discrepancies, but the algorithmic fairness implications of group-specific missingness
  are not well understood. Despite its potential impact, imputation is too often an
  overlooked preprocessing step. When explicitly considered, attention is placed on
  overall performance, ignoring how this preprocessing can reinforce group-specific
  inequities. Our work questions this choice by studying how imputation affects downstream
  algorithmic fairness. First, we provide a structured view of the relationship between
  clinical presence mechanisms and group-specific missingness patterns. Then, through
  simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the imputation choice
  influences marginalised group performance and that no imputation strategy consistently
  reduces disparities. Importantly, our results show that current practices may endanger
  health equity as similarly performing imputation strategies at the population level
  can affect marginalised groups differently. Finally, we propose recommendations
  for mitigating inequities that may stem from a neglected step of the machine learning
  pipeline.

title: Improving Radiology Report Generation Systems by Removing Hallucinated References
  to Non-existent Priors
software: https://github.com/rajpurkarlab/CXR-ReDonE
abstract: 'Current deep learning models trained to generate radiology reports from
  chest radiographs are capable of producing clinically accurate, clear, and actionable
  text that can advance patient care. However, such systems all succumb to the same
  problem: making hallucinated references to non-existent prior reports. Such hallucinations
  occur because these models are trained on datasets of real-world patient reports
  that inherently refer to priors. To this end, we propose two methods to remove references
  to priors in radiology reports: (1) a GPT-3-based few-shot approach to rewrite medical
  reports without references to priors; and (2) a BioBERT-based token classification
  approach to directly remove words referring to priors. We use the aforementioned
  approaches to modify MIMIC-CXR, a publicly available dataset of chest X-rays and
  their associated free-text radiology reports; we then retrain CXR-RePaiR, a radiology
  report generation system, on the adapted MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find that our re-trained
  model—which we call CXR-ReDonE—outperforms previous report generation methods on
  clinical metrics, achieving an average BERTScore of 0.2351 ($2.57%$ absolute improvement).
  We expect our approach to be broadly valuable in enabling current radiology report
  generation systems to be more directly integrated into clinical pipelines. '

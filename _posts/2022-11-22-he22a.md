title: An Empirical Study on Activity Recognition in Long Surgical Videos
abstract: Activity recognition in surgical videos is a key research area for developing
  next-generation devices and workflow monitoring systems. Since surgeries are long
  processes with highly-variable lengths, deep learning models used for surgical videos
  often consist of a two-stage setup using a backbone and temporal sequence model.
  In this paper, we investigate many state-of-the-art backbones and temporal models
  to find architectures that yield the strongest performance for surgical activity
  recognition. We first benchmark the models performance on a large-scale activity
  recognition dataset containing over 800 surgery videos captured in multiple clinical
  operating rooms. We further evaluate the models on the two smaller public datasets,
  the Cholec80 and Cataract-101 datasets, containing only 80 and 101 videos respectively.
  We empirically found that Swin-Transformer+BiGRU temporal model yielded strong performance
  on both datasets. Finally, we investigate the adaptability of the model to new domains
  by fine-tuning models to a new hospital and experimenting with a recent unsupervised
  domain adaptation approach.

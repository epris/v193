title: 'mmVAE: multimorbidity clustering using Relaxed Bernoulli $β$-Variational Autoencoders'
software: https://github.com/cwlgadd/mmVAE
abstract: The prevalence of chronic disease multimorbidity is a significant and increasing
  challenge for health systems. In many cases, the occurrence of one chronic disease
  leads to the development of one or more other chronic conditions. This exerts a
  significant challenge in improving patient outcomes and is a growing challenge globally
  as average population age increases. Using electronic health record information
  to identify patterns of co-occurring conditions is seen as an unbiased means of
  understanding multimorbidity but most studies have adopted off-the-shelf algorithmic
  techniques that are not tailored for the application. We present a novel bespoke
  approach for multimorbidity clustering based on a highly customised version of a
  $\beta$-variational autoencoder. We incorporate the use of minimum entropy clustering
  to identify sparse, low-dimensional factored representations that link at a feature-level
  to the observed patient-level multimorbidity profiles. We demonstrate how the approach
  can be used to explore complex structure in a population-scale health data sets
  by examining data from a UK population of nearly 300,000 women in pregnancy suffering
  from multimorbidity.

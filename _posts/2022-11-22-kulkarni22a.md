title: Predicting Treatment Adherence of Tuberculosis Patients at Scale
abstract: Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious bacterial disease, is a significant cause
  of death, especially in low-income countries, with an estimated ten million new
  cases reported globally in 2020. While TB is treatable, non-adherence to the medication
  regimen is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, proactively identifying
  patients at risk of dropping off their medication regimen enables corrective measures
  to mitigate adverse outcomes. Using a proxy measure of extreme non-adherence and
  a dataset of nearly $700,000$ patients from four states in India, we formulate and
  solve the machine learning (ML) problem of early prediction of non-adherence based
  on a custom rank-based metric. We train ML models and evaluate against baselines,
  achieving a $\sim 100%$ lift over rule-based baselines and $\sim 214%$ over a random
  classifier, taking into account country-wide large-scale future deployment. We deal
  with various issues in the process, including data quality, high-cardinality categorical
  data, low target prevalence, distribution shift, variation across cohorts, algorithmic
  fairness, and the need for robustness and explainability. Our findings indicate
  that risk stratification of non-adherent patients is a viable, deployable-at-scale
  ML solution. As the official AI partner of Indiaâ€™s Central TB Division, we are working
  on multiple city and state-level pilots with the goal of pan-India deployment.

title: 'Extend and Explain: Interpreting Very Long Language Models'
software: https://github.com/Optum/long-medical-document-lms
abstract: While Transformer language models (LMs) are state-of-the-art for information
  extraction, long text introduces computational challenges requiring suboptimal preprocessing
  steps or alternative model architectures. Sparse attention LMs can represent longer
  sequences, overcoming performance hurdles. However, it remains unclear how to explain
  predictions from these models, as not all tokens attend to each other in the self-attention
  layers, and long sequences pose computational challenges for explainability algorithms
  when runtime depends on document length. These challenges are severe in the medical
  context where documents can be very long, and machine learning (ML) models must
  be auditable and trustworthy. We introduce a novel Masked Sampling Procedure (MSP)
  to identify the text blocks that contribute to a prediction, apply MSP in the context
  of predicting diagnoses from medical text, and validate our approach with a blind
  review by two clinicians. Our method identifies $\approx 1.7\times$ more clinically
  informative text blocks than the previous state-of-the-art, runs up to $100\times$
  faster, and is tractable for generating important phrase pairs. MSP is particularly
  well-suited to long LMs but can be applied to any text classifier. We provide a
  general implementation here. https://github.com/Optum/long-medical-document-lms

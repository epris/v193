title: Instability in clinical risk stratiﬁcation models using deep learning
abstract: 'While it has been well known in the ML community that deep learning models
  suffer from instability, the consequences for healthcare deployments are under characterised.
  We study the stability of different model architectures trained on electronic health
  records, using a set of outpatient prediction tasks as a case study. We show that
  repeated training runs of the same deep learning model on the same training data
  can result in significantly different outcomes at a patient level even though global
  performance metrics remain stable. We propose two stability metrics for measuring
  the effect of randomness of model training, as well as mitigation strategies for
  improving model stability. '

title: 'Neurodevelopmental Phenotype Prediction: A State-of-the-Art Deep Learning
  Model'

abstract: A major challenge in medical image analysis is the automated detection of
  biomarkers from neuroimaging data. Traditional approaches, often based on image
  registration, are limited in capturing the high variability of cortical organisation
  across individuals. Deep learning methods have been shown to be successful in overcoming
  this difficulty, and some of them have even outperformed medical professionals on
  certain datasets. In this paper, we apply a deep neural network to analyse the cortical
  surface data of neonates, derived from the publicly available Developing Human Connectome
  Project (dHCP). Our goal is to identify neurodevelopmental biomarkers and to predict
  gestational age at birth based on these biomarkers. Using scans of preterm neonates
  acquired around the term-equivalent age, we were able to investigate the impact
  of preterm birth on cortical growth and maturation during late gestation. Besides
  reaching state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, the proposed model has much fewer
  parameters than the baselines, and its error stays low on both unregistered and
  registered cortical surfaces.

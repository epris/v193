title: Identifying Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Multiple Outcomes using Joint
  Confidence Intervals
software: https://github.com/pargaw/MOP-JCI
abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) are commonly identified during randomized
  controlled trials (RCTs). Identifying subgroups of patients with similar treatment
  effects is of high interest in clinical research to advance precision medicine.
  Often, multiple clinical outcomes are measured during an RCT, each having a potentially
  heterogeneous effect. Recently there has been high interest in identifying subgroups
  from HTEs, however, there has been less focus on developing tools in settings where
  there are multiple outcomes. In this work, we propose a framework for partitioning
  the covariate space to identify subgroups across multiple outcomes based on the
  joint CIs. We test our algorithm on synthetic and semi-synthetic data where there
  are two outcomes, and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to capture the HTE
  in both outcomes simultaneously.

title: Differentiable programming for functional connectomics
software: https://hypercoil.github.io/
abstract: Mapping the functional connectome has the potential to uncover key insights
  into brain organisation. However, existing workflows for functional connectomics
  are limited in their adaptability to new data, and principled workflow design is
  a challenging combinatorial problem. We introduce an analytic paradigm that implements
  common operations used in functional connectomics as fully differentiable processing
  blocks. Under this paradigm, workflow configurations exist as reparameterisations
  of a differentiable functional that interpolates them. The differentiable program
  that we ultimately envision occupies a niche midway between traditional pipelines
  and end-to-end neural networks, combining the glass-box tractability and domain
  knowledge of the former with the amenability to optimisation of the latter. In this
  preliminary work, we provide a proof of concept for differentiable connectomics,
  demonstrating the capacity of our processing blocks across three separate problem
  domains critically important to brain mapping. We also provide a software library
  to facilitate adoption. Our differentiable framework is competitive with state-of-the-art
  methods in functional brain parcellation, time series denoising, and covariance
  modelling. Taken together, our results demonstrate the promise of differentiable
  programming for functional connectomics.

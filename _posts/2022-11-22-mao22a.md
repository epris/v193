title: Towards Cross-Modal Causal Structure and Representation Learning
abstract: Does the SARS-CoV-2 virus cause patients’ chest X-Rays ground-glass opacities?
  Does an IDH-mutation cause differences in patients’ MRI images? Conventional causal
  discovery algorithms, although well developed to uncover the cause-effect relationships
  on structured data, cannot elucidate causal relations between unstructured images
  and structured scalar variables due to the complexity of the former. In this paper,
  we consider causal discovery between images and structured (scalar) variables. Specifically,
  we derive low dimensional image representations to analyze with structured variables.
  We propose a two-module amortized variational algorithm named <b>C</b>ross-<b>M</b>odal
  Variational <b>C</b>ausal representation and structure <b>L</b>earning (<em>CMCL</em>).
  <em>CMCL</em> jointly learns identifiable representations given a set of independent
  structured variables and causal relations via formulating latent representations
  and structured variables into a direct acyclic graph. Moreover, we further enforce
  counterfactual invariance/variance onto representations. We demonstrate that <em>CMCL</em>
  outperforms other related methods on synthetic datasets and validate causal relations
  on semi-synthetic datasets by visualization.

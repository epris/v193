abstract: 'The emergence of deep learning in the medical field has popularized the
  development of models to predict survival outcomes from histopathology images in
  precision oncology.  Graph-based formalism has opened interesting perspectives for
  generating informative representations, as they can be context-aware and model local
  and global topological structures in the tumor’s microenvironment. However, the
  critical issue in using graph representations lies in their generalizability. They
  can suffer from overfitting due to their large sizes or high discrepancies between
  nodes due to random sampling from WSI. In addition, standard graph formulations
  are limited to pairwise interactions, which can sometimes fail to represent the
  reality observed in histopathology and hinder the interpretability of those interactions.
  In this work, we present Hyper-AdaC, an adaptive clustering-based hypergraph representation
  to model high-order correlations among different regions of the WSIs while being
  compact enough to help graph neural networks generalize in the case of survival
  prediction. We evaluate our approach on $5$ different public available cancer datasets.
  Our method outperforms most state-of-the-art graph-based methods for survival prediction
  with WSIs, creating a more efficient and robust alternative to other graph representations.
  Moreover, due to our formulation, attention maps are depicted at different resolutions
  depending on the tissue characteristics of each WSI. The code is available at: https://github.com/HakimBenkirane/Hyper-adaC.'

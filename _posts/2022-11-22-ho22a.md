title: Machine and Deep Learning Methods for Predicting Immune Checkpoint Blockade
  Response
abstract: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has improved treatment options
  in various cancer malignancies and holds promise for increasing the overall survival
  of treated patients. However, only a small proportion of patients benefit from ICB
  treatment. Furthermore, ICB therapy has been known to induce adverse autoimmunity
  reactions in certain patients. These two reasons motivate the clinical need to identify
  factors that predict a patientâ€™s response to ICB treatment. In our study, we developed
  several machine and deep learning-based models to predict response to ICB treatment,
  using a real-world tabular dataset across sixteen cancer types. We showed that our
  best model CB16, which is based on gradient boosting, outperforms all-known published
  results for this task, with sensitivity and specificity scores of 80.6% and 78.8%
  respectively. Our model also offers insights to clinical interpretability through
  the use of the SHAP explanation framework, which are consistent with known important
  predictors. Next, in order to see if deep learning can improve performance, we propose
  a methodology for the design of deep neural networks that addresses the lack of
  spatial and temporal structure in tabular data. Our approach is based on a combination
  of learning ordered representations and ensembling techniques. We show that, for
  the ICB prediction problem, current SOTA deep-learning architectures such as TabNet
  and TabTransformer do not perform well while our method achieves good performance.
  Our method achieves an F1 score 12.4 percentage points beyond that of TabTransformer,
  and sensitivity and specificity scores of 77.3% and 62.2% respectively. Through
  our work, we hope to improve the task of predicting ICB response, and contribute
  towards the creation of high-performance and interpretable AI models for real-world
  tabular data.

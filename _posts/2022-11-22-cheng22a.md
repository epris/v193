title: Meta-analysis of individualized treatment rules via sign-coherency
software: https://github.com/jay-jojo-cheng/metacoop
abstract: Medical treatments tailored to a patientâ€™s baseline characteristics hold
  the potential of improving patient outcomes while reducing negative side effects.
  Learning individualized treatment rules (ITRs) often requires aggregation of multiple
  datasets(sites); however, current ITR methodology does not take between-site heterogeneity
  into account, which can hurt model generalizability when deploying back to each
  site. To address this problem, we develop a method for individual-level meta-analysis
  of ITRs, which jointly learns site-specific ITRs while borrowing information about
  feature sign-coherency via a scientifically-motivated directionality principle.
  We also develop an adaptive procedure for model tuning, using information criteria
  tailored to the ITR learning problem. We study the proposed methods through numerical
  experiments to understand their performance under different levels of between-site
  heterogeneity and apply the methodology to estimate ITRs in a large multi-center
  database of electronic health records. This work extends several popular methodologies
  for estimating ITRs (A-learning, weighted learning) to the multiple-sites setting.

title: Feature Allocation Approach for Multimorbidity Trajectory Modelling
software: https://github.com/thysics/WF-MTM
abstract: A multimorbidity trajectory charts the time-dependent acquisition of disease
  conditions in an individual. This is important for understanding and managing patients
  who have a complex array of multiple chronic conditions, particularly later in life.
  We construct a novel probabilistic generative model for multimorbidity acquisition
  within a Bayesian framework of latent feature allocation, which allows an individualâ€™s
  morbidity profile to be driven by multiple latent factors and allows the modelling
  of age-dependent multimorbidity trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of our
  model in applications to both simulated data and disease event data from patient
  electronic health records. In each setting, we show our model can reconstruct clinically
  meaningful latent multimorbidity patterns and their age-dependent prevalence trajectories.

title: An Extensive Data Processing Pipeline for MIMIC-IV
software: https://github.com/healthylaife/MIMIC-IV-Data-Pipeline
abstract: An increasing amount of research is being devoted to applying machine learning
  methods to electronic health record (EHR) data for various clinical purposes. This
  growing area of research has exposed the challenges of the accessibility of EHRs.
  MIMIC is a popular, public, and free EHR dataset in a raw format that has been used
  in numerous studies. The absence of standardized preprocessing steps can be, however,
  a significant barrier to the wider adoption of this rare resource. Additionally,
  this absence can reduce the reproducibility of the developed tools and limit the
  ability to compare the results among similar studies. In this work, we provide a
  greatly customizable pipeline to extract, clean, and preprocess the data available
  in the fourth version of the MIMIC dataset (MIMIC-IV). The pipeline also presents
  an end-to-end wizard-like package supporting predictive model creations and evaluations.
  The pipeline covers a range of clinical prediction tasks which can be broadly classified
  into four categories - readmission, length of stay, mortality, and phenotype prediction.
  The tool is publicly available at https://github.com/healthylaife/MIMIC-IV-Data-Pipeline.

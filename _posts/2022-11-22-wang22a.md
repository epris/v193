title: Improving Sepsis Prediction Model Generalization With Optimal Transport
abstract: 'Sepsis is a deadly condition affecting many patients in the hospital. There
  have been many efforts to build models that predict the onset of sepsis, but these
  models tend to perform terribly when validated on external data from different hospitals
  due to distributional shifts in the data and insufficient samples from sepsis patients.
  To circumvent the curse from noisy and unbalanced samples, we develop a novel two-step
  approach for sepsis prediction: given feature-label points from the source domain
  and feature points from the target domain, to obtain a sepsis predictor that has
  satisfactory performance at the target domain. The proposed algorithm first learns
  how to transform sample points from the source domain to the target domain, and
  then applies the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) technique with the Sinkhorn
  distance and asymmetric cost function to reliably obtain a classifier with satisfactory
  out-of-sample performance. Connections between our proposed formulation and widely
  used classification models, i.e., DRO formulation with the Wasserstein distance
  and regularized logistic regression formulation, are also uncovered. Numerical experiments
  with synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of the
  proposed method.'

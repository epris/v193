title: Predicting attrition patterns from pediatric weight management programs
software: https://github.com/healthylaife/wm_attrition
abstract: Obesity is a major public health concern. Multidisciplinary pediatric weight
  management programs are considered standard treatment for children with obesity
  who are not able to be successfully managed in the primary care setting. Despite
  their great potential, high dropout rates (referred to as attrition) are a major
  hurdle in delivering successful interventions. Predicting attrition patterns can
  help providers reduce the alarmingly high rates of attrition (up to 80%) by engaging
  in earlier and more personalized interventions. Previous work has mainly focused
  on finding static predictors of attrition on smaller datasets and has achieved limited
  success in effective prediction. In this study, we have collected  a five-year comprehensive
  dataset of 4,550 children from diverse backgrounds receiving treatment at four pediatric
  weight management programs in the US. We then developed a  machine learning pipeline
  to predict (a) the likelihood of attrition, and (b) the change in body-mass index
  (BMI) percentile of children, at different time points after joining the weight
  management program. Our pipeline is greatly customized for this problem using advanced
  machine learning techniques to process longitudinal data, smaller-size data, and
  interrelated prediction tasks. The proposed method showed strong prediction performance
  as measured by  AUROC scores  (average AUROC of 0.77 for predicting attrition, and
  0.78 for predicting weight outcomes).

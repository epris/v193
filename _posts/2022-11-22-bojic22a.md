title: 'SleepQA: A Health Coaching Dataset on Sleep for Extractive Question Answering'
software: https://github.com/IvaBojic/SleepQA
abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems can support health coaches in facilitating
  clientsâ€™ lifestyle behavior changes (e.g., in adopting healthy sleep habits). In
  this paper, we design a domain-specific QA pipeline for sleep coaching. To this
  end, we release SleepQA, a dataset created from 7,005 passages comprising 4,250
  training examples with single annotations and 750 examples with 5-way annotations.
  We fine-tuned different domain-specific BERT models on our dataset and perform extensive
  automatic and human evaluation of the resulting end-to-end QA pipeline. Comparisons
  of our pipeline with baseline show improvements in domain-specific natural language
  processing on real-world questions. We hope that this dataset will lead to wider
  research interest in this important health domain.

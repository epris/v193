title: A Path Towards Clinical Adaptation of Accelerated MRI
software: https://github.com/michael-s-yao/accMRI
abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstructs images of clinical anatomies from sparsely
  sampled signal data to reduce patient scan times. While recent works have leveraged
  deep learning to accomplish this task, such approaches have often only been explored
  in simulated environments where there is no signal corruption or resource limitations.
  In this work, we explore augmentations to neural network MRI image reconstructors
  to enhance their clinical relevancy. Namely, we propose a ConvNet model for detecting
  sources of image artifacts that achieves a classifier $\mathit{F}_{2}$ score of
  79.1%. We also demonstrate that training reconstructors on MR signal data with variable
  acceleration factors can improve their average performance during a clinical patient
  scan by up to 2%. We offer a loss function to overcome catastrophic forgetting when
  models learn to reconstruct MR images of multiple anatomies and orientations. Finally,
  we propose a method for using simulated phantom data to pre-train reconstructors
  in situations with limited clinically acquired datasets and compute capabilities.
  Our results provide a potential path forward for clinical adaptation of accelerated
  MRI.

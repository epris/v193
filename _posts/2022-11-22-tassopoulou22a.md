title: Deep Kernel Learning with Temporal Gaussian Processes for Clinical Variable
  Prediction in Alzheimer’s Disease
abstract: Longitudinal prediction of Alzheimer’s disease progression is of high importance
  for early diagnosis and clinical trial design. We propose to predict the longitudinal
  changes of neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive scores by leveraging the expressivity
  of Deep Kernel Learning with single-task Gaussian Processes. The temporal function
  that describes the progression of the biomarker is learned through a Gaussian Process.
  By learning these temporal functions we can predict any future value of a clinical
  variable. We apply our method for extrapolation of neuroimaging biomarkers, SPARE-AD
  index, and cognitive metric Adas-Cog13, both significant predictors for the pathological
  and cognitive changes of Alzheimer’s Disease. The method has been validated in two
  cohorts, ADNI and BLSA, where the results show that the proposed method significantly
  outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art models in AD progression prediction both
  on providing point estimates and quantifying uncertainty.

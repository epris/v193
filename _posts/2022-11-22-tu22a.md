title: Automated LOINC Standardization Using Pre-trained Large Language Models
abstract: Harmonization of local source concepts to standard clinical terminologies
  is a prerequisite for multi-center data aggregation and sharing. Challenges in automating
  the mapping process stem from the idiosyncratic source encoding schemes adopted
  by different health systems and the lack of large publicly available training data.
  In this study, we aim to develop a scalable and generalizable machine learning tool
  to facilitate standardizing laboratory observations to the Logical Observation Identifiers
  Names and Codes (LOINC). Specifically, we leverage the contextual embedding from
  pre-trained T5 models and propose a two-stage fine-tuning strategy based on contrastive
  learning to enable learning in a few-shot setting without manual feature engineering.
  Our method utilizes unlabeled general LOINC ontology and data augmentation to achieve
  high accuracy on retrieving the most relevant LOINC targets when limited amount
  of labeled data are available. We further show that our model generalizes well to
  unseen targets. Taken together, our approach shows great potential to reduce manual
  effort in LOINC standardization and can be easily extended to mapping other terminologies.

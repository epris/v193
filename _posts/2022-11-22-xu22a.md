title: Counterfactual and Factual Reasoning over Hypergraphs for Interpretable Clinical
  Predictions on EHR
software: https://github.com/ritaranx/CACHE
abstract: Electronic Health Record modeling is crucial for digital medicine. However,
  existing models ignore higher-order interactions among medical codes and their causal
  relations towards downstream clinical predictions. To address such limitations,
  we propose a novel framework CACHE, to provide <em>effective</em> and <em>insightful</em>
  clinical predictions based on hypergraph representation learning and counterfactual
  and factual reasoning techniques. Experiments on two real EHR datasets show the
  superior performance of CACHE. Case studies with a domain expert illustrate a preferred
  capability of CACHE in generating clinically meaningful interpretations towards
  the correct predictions.
